# Changelog

All notable changes to BaseHarbor are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Formal Semantic Versioning and GitHub Release process for the `baha` CLI.
- Reproducible release archives for Linux amd64 and arm64.
- SHA-256 checksums and GitHub build-provenance attestations for release artifacts.
- Versioned runtime container tags aligned with CLI releases.
- Verified release installer for released `baha` binaries.
- Bilingual GitHub Pages documentation with English as the default and German under `/de/`.

### Changed

- The moving development container tag is `edge`; `latest` is reserved for stable releases.
- Control-plane runtime state is user-global by default instead of repository-relative.
- Renovate automation is restricted to low-risk updates; platform, major and security-sensitive changes require review.

## Release history

The first public release will be `v0.1.0` after the release pipeline and real-product acceptance gates are verified.
